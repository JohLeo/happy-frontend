## Project Happy Thoughts Frontend - https://happy-mongo-api-jl.netlify.app

## ‚úì The brief
The goal for this project was to build an API similar to an API used in a previous frontend project. We needed to structure it so that the URL-fetch could be replaced with the new one and get the app working with our frontend from before. The "app" is named Happy Thoughts and is created so that you can read, post and like new happy thoughts.

## üèîÔ∏è The problem

Started by looking and understandinig the data structure of the api we've used earlier.
Then tested the endpoints (GET, POST, PATCH) through Postman. 
Had some issues with the PATCH request and needed to look through naming for frontend vs api to solve the issue. Really liked this project since it gave me a good understanding on the correlation between back- and frontend.
